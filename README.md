# Self-Powered Systems Simulator (selfpoweredsys)

The selfpoweredsys library was developed to simulate self-powered sensors operating under a fluctuating energy source.

Features and capabilities:
 - Functions to automatically download streamflow velocity data from the usgs NWIS database and evaluate missing samples.
 - To simulate energy generation from minituarized hydro turbine models and streamflow data. 
 - To simulate energy storage and consumption by a sensor station.
 - To evaluate missing samples given monitoring station energy consumption, storage and generation.

Modules: 
 - Energy Harvesting Evironment (environment)
 - Energy Storage (estorage)
 - Energy Harvester (harvester)
 - Energy Consumption (load)
 - Simulation Main Scripts (simtools)
